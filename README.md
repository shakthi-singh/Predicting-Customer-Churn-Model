# Predicting-Customer-Churn-Model
Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn using historical data, including user demographics, contract types, and subscription termination records. Applied data cleaning, feature engineering, and classification techniques to uncover key churn indicators and improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning. The project involved close collaboration within a team to validate results, share insights, and ensure alignment with real-world business applications.
